# Coffee Shop Dashboard (Excel-Project)
I have created a comprehensive coffee shop project in excel by creating a dashboard and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.
## Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyse retail sales data to gain actionable insights that will enhance the performance of the Coffee Shop
## Dataset
- <a href="https://github.com/AmanFarooqui/Data-Excel-Project/blob/main/customers.csv">Customer </a> <br>
- <a href="https://github.com/AmanFarooqui/Data-Excel-Project/blob/main/orders.csv">orders </a> <br>
- <a href="https://github.com/AmanFarooqui/Data-Excel-Project/blob/main/products.csv">products </a>
## Questions
- How do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day?<br>
- Are there any peak times for sales activity? <br>
- What is the total sales revenue for each month?<br>
-  How do sales vary across different store locations?<br> 
- What is the average price/order per person? <br>
- Which products are the bestselling in terms of quantity and revenue? <br>
- How do sales vary by product category and type?<br>
## Process
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
-	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
-	Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic
